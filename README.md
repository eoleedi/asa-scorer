# Fluency Scorer

## Introduction
It's my implementation for speech fluency assessment model
The idea for this model is from the paper [An ASR-Free Fluency Scoring Approach with Self-Supervised Learning](<https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09928>) (Wei Liu, Kaiqi Fu, Xiaohai Tian, Shuju Shi, Wei Li, Zejun Ma, Tan Lee) proposed in the ICASSP 2023.

## Data
The SpeechOcean762 dataset used in my work is an open dataset licenced with CC BY 4.0. 
It can be downloaded from [this link](<https://www.openslr.org/101>).
